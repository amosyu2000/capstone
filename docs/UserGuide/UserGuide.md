## 3. Introduction

This document is the User Guide for the Cyclops Ride Assist (CRA). It will cover all required installations, assemblies, mounting and dismounting, and proper usage. Furthermore, some common troubleshooting techniques will be introduced as well as some frequently asked questions. 
The CRA is an all-in-one, easily mountable, and quick to setup system that adds modern car safety features onto a bicycle or motorcyCle. These features include rear vehicle detection, crash detection, and automatic video and data capture with upload. This ensures that the Cyclops Ride Assist can be immediately used out of package. The User Guide will thus outline the best practices on mounting the CRA to their own personal bicycle.

## 4. Hardware Installation 
### 4.1. Hardware Overview

As the Cyclops Ride Assist is a complete product consisting of both hardware and software, it is imperative to correctly install both to ensure proper use. This section will outline the proper technique required to do so. Both the main and rear housing assembly will be pre-assembled prior to delivery to a user.

Pictured below in Figure 3.1 are the components of the Cyclops Ride Assist. Cables are provided. Batteries are not included.

</div>

### 5.3. Logging Data from the CRA
In the event of a system recognized collision, data logging will occur automatically 10 seconds after the crash without any user intervention. 

Logging can also occur when the user presses the BLUE capture button on the side of the main housing.  

| Step Number |  Instruction |
|:--|:--|
| 1 | Ensure the Pre-Trip Power On Sequence has been followed completely. |
| 2 | Press the BLUE capture button labelled with a camera icon located on the right side of the main housing. |

<div align="center">

<p id="capt">Figure 5.3: The Capture Button.</p>
</div>

### 5.4. Interpreting a Capture Sequence Debug

Following a system detected collision or capture button press, the CRA will do the following actions automatically: 

| Action |  Instruction |
|:--|:--|
| 1 | Following a system detected crash or capture button press, the CRA will log 60 seconds of accelerometer, camera, and LiDAR data.  |
| 2 | Following the logging, the user is notified separately of the success or failure of each of these 3 logging events. |
| 3 | Wait between 0 to 10 seconds after a system detected crash or capture button press for all footage and data to log.|
| 4 |Note the blinking color of the 3 LEDs closest to the user. Blue would indicate a SUCCESS and red would indicate a FAILURE. Please refer to [Section 6: Troubleshooting](#6-troubleshooting) for further help.|
| 4a |The LEDs correspond to: <br/> Accelerometer (closest LED to user)<br/>  Camera (2nd closest LED to user) <br/> LiDAR (3rd closest LED to user)|

<div align="center">

</div>

### 5.5. Retrieving the Video, LiDAR, and Accelerometer Data
In order to view the video footage, LiDAR files, or accelerometer data files, a personal computer must be used. The following steps will outline how to do so.

| Step |  Instruction |
|:--|:--|
| 1 | Open the sliding door on the rear of the main housing to expose the USB stick.  |
| 2 | Pull the USB stick out of the USB port.  |
| 3 | Plug the USB stick into your device (personal computer, laptop, etc.)|
| 4 |Copy any videos or files you would like to save onto your device. All files are located inside "Capture" folders.|
| 5 |(OPTIONAL) Reformat the USB stick as FAT32 to wipe all data.|

</div>

## 6. Troubleshooting
In the event of an error, please do the following: 

| Action |  Instruction |
|:--|:--|
| 1 | Determine the cause of the issue (accelerometer, camear, LiDAR) based on the LED lights as outlined in Step 3 and 4 of [Section 5.4](#54-interpreting-a-capture-sequence-debug) |
| 1a | If the accelerometer is the issue, open the CRA Main Housing. Check to see if the accelerometer cables are properly connected to the microcontroller. |
| 1b | If the camera is the issue, open the CRA Main Housing. Check to see if the camera cables are properly connected to the microcontroller.|
| 1c | If the LiDAR is the issue, ensure that the wires are connected properly at the CRA Rear Housing.|
| 2 | If the above actions do not work, please power off the CRA using the BLACK button under the '0', wait 30s, and then power it on using the WHITE button under the '1' button.|
| 3 | If the above actions do not work, please power off the CRA through the battery, wait 30s, re-power on the battery, and then power the CRA on using the WHITE button under the '1' button.|
