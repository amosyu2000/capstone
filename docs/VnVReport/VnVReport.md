### 9.1. Reflection
(How is the VnV Report different from the VnV Plan? Was there anything that was planned in the VnV Plan that was executed differently in the VnV Report? 

If so, why did the changes occur, and how could we have anticipated those changes for the future? 

If not, how was your team able to clearly predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build the evidence that demonstrates the required quality?)
