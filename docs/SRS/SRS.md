## 2 Project Drivers
### 2.1 Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a system that helps cyclists to have a more secured experience especially on roads without bike lanes.

Cyclops Ride Assist (CRA) is going to be an all-in-one, easily mountable, and quick to setup system that adds modern car safety features onto a bike, such as blind spot detection and crash detection. The system will also have a built in headlamp that will illuminate during night time, not just for the cyclist to see but also for cars around to realize the bike. 
### 2.2 Project Scope
CRA is going to be a bike assist system with convenient mounting, accurate crash detection, video buffering and saving, reliable blindspot monitoring and a user controlled headlamp that helps cyclist to have a peace of mind while riding on the road. Although CRA is primarily targeted towards road cyclists, it will able be useful for cyclists who ride on mountains or trails.
### 2.3 Behaviour Overview
The user can press the power button to turn on the CRA. Once it turns on, it will start to record the forward point of view of the bike. If a bike crash is detected, the system will store the past five minutes of footage so the user can look back at the events leading up to the crash. Also on the back side of the system, CRA will watch out for cars approaching the bike at blind spots and alert the cyclist with an indicator. The system also has a headlamp that is easily switched on and off for dark environment.
### 2.4 Project Stakeholders
The project stakeholders are as follows:  
- The project proposers (Aaron Li, Amos Cheung, Amos Yu, Brian Le, Manny Lemos)
- The project supervisor (Dr Spencer Smith)
- The teaching assistants (Nicholas Annable)
- The user (cyclist)
### 2.5 Product Users
The user will be all cyclists.
## 3 Project Constraints
add content
### 3.1 Mandated Constraints
A list of constraints which will adhered to during the design and development of this system.

**Mandated Constraint 1:**  
This capstone project must be completed prior to the final demonstration.  
**Rationale 1:**  
Project deadlines provided in the course outline dictate project milestone which must be met. One such milestone is the final demonstration which occurs between March 20-31 2023.  

**Mandated Constraint 2:**  
The total cost of the components used in this design must not exceed $750.  
**Rationale 2:**  
The final deliverable must be a competitor in the open market. Further, using funds to purchase an off-the-shelf product is not allowed.  

**Mandated Constraint 3:**  
The system must be able to analyze inputs to produce desired results in real time.  
**Rationale 3:**  
Real time analysis and response is an integral component of the cyclops ride assist system. More precisely, desired results are only of value if they can be delivered on time every time.  

### 3.2 Naming Conventions and Definitions
#### 3.2.1 Naming Conventions
Client: see User.  
CRA: abbreviation for Cyclops Ride Assist.  
Cyclist: a person who operates a bicycle as a means of transportation.  
User: a person who will operate the final product. See Cyclist.

### 3.3 Relevant Facts and Assumptions  
#### 3.3.1 Relevant Facts  
- example fact 1
#### 3.3.2 Assumptions  
Assumptions will enable developers to cull the scope of the problem(s) being undertaken. As such, assumptions will detail limitations of the system.  
**Assumption 1:**  
Cyclists will mount and dismount their bikes with care.  
**Rationale 1:**  
Violent mounting and dismounting of one's bicycle may result in unintended triggering of crash detection and subsequent video logging. The system will not be able to distinguish between violent (dis)mounting and true crashes.  

**Assumption 2:**  
While on the road, cyclists will abide by traffic laws. This means travelling in marked bike lanes where available.  
**Rationale 2:**  
The system will not be able to distinguish between parked vehicles, which may appear momentarily in a cyclists blind-spot, and moving vehicles. As a result, if a cyclist is not travelling in designated bike lanes they may be subject to increased instances of false blind-spot detection triggers.
