North American cities are shifting from a car-centric design to greener forms of transportation. It is expected that more people will adopt cycling as their primary method of commuting. However, it is difficult for a cyclist to keep track of everything going on around them, especially during busy times.

Cyclops Ride Assist (CRA) is an easy-to-use Ride monitoring system that is mounted on a user's bicycle. It provides its users with comprehensive crash avoidance paired with intelligent crash detection triggering camera footage and sensor data logging.  CRA safeguards its user's on their rides from start to finish.
