# Cyclops
North American cities are shifting from a car-centric design to greener forms of transportation. It is expected that more people will adopt cycling as their primary method of commuting. However, it is difficult for a cyclist to keep track of everything going on around them, especially during busy times.

Cyclops will be an easy-to-use system that includes a mobile Android application that will allow its users to have full detection of their surroundings during their trip from start to finish, cameras to capture and record from various angles, and sensors to detect vehicles in blind-spots and accidents. In the event of any cycling collision, Cyclops will automatically record the scene for any investigations.
